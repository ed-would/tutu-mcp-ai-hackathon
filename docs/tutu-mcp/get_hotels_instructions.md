# Hotels playbook (`search_hotels` -> `get_offer_details` ->
`create_checkout_link`)

## Checkout
Hotels have an `explicit/hotel` deeplink,
the same stateless handoff family as the transport tools — the user opens
the link and Tutu builds the cart in THEIR browser session (cold browser
works). `create_checkout_link` (product_type=hotels) has TWO modes off the
row's `checkout_ref`:
- **Page (default, `kind="deeplink"`)** — `hotel_alias` + dates + guests
  (+ `search_id`) open the hotel page with everything pre-filled for the
  user to pick a room. This is the official replacement for the old
  `offers/details` page link.
- **Straight-to-cart (`kind="checkout_deeplink"`)** — also pass an
  `offer_pack_hash` and the link mints the cart for that pack. It MUST be a
  SPECIFIC room rate's `offerpack_hash` from `get_offer_details`
  (`rooms[].rates[].offerpack_hash`). The listing `best_offer.offerpack_hash`
  does NOT mint a cart — the redirector falls back
  to the hotel page — so it's not carried in `checkout_ref`; get the cart hash
  from a room the user actually picked (same shape as rail seats from
  `get_rail_seatmap`). A stale/unbookable pack lands on the hotel page instead
  of erroring (`fallback_to_details`), so this mode is always safe.
You can still hand over `best_offer.checkout_url` directly — it's on every
search row. (If a ref lacks `hotel_alias`, the
tool returns that page with `kind="hotel_page"`.)

## geo_id: hotels vs transport (critical)
`search_hotels` resolves `city_name` against Tutu's hotel-specific geo
index — the same one hotel.tutu.ru's search box uses — NOT the transport
suggest. It is region-aware: for a resort zone it picks the `region` that
aggregates the sibling посёлки (e.g. «Курорт "Архыз"» covers посёлок
Архыз + Романтик + Нижний Архыз; the Роза Хутор region covers a locality
that is near-empty on its own), and for a plain city it picks that city.
`meta.resolved_geo` tells you what it searched: `geo_type`
(`region` | `locality`), `hotels_count` (catalog size), and `also_geo`
(the narrower/alternative geos sharing the name).
- ALWAYS prefer `city_name`. State which `resolved_geo.name` was searched;
  when `geo_type=region`, you may add that it covers the whole resort
  zone, and offer an `also_geo` locality if the user wants to narrow.
- **A specific hotel you don't see on page 1 is NOT a different geo.** The
  list is relevance-sorted and a region holds hundreds of properties, so a
  named hotel (especially a new / 0-review one) is usually just deeper —
  paginate (`page`+`page_size`, `meta.has_more`) or fetch it directly with
  `get_offer_details` by its `hotel_id`. Do NOT tell the user it lives in a
  separate geo_id; the region search already spans the zone.
- If you must pass `geo_id`, take it ONLY from a previous `search_hotels`
  response (`meta.geo_id` / `meta.resolved_geo.geo_id` / `also_geo[].geo_id`).
  NEVER reuse a `geo_id` / `from_geo_id` / `to_geo_id` from `search_avia` /
  `search_rail` / `search_bus` / `search_etrain` / `search_multitransport`
  — those are transport entries (airports, stations) and frequently have no
  hotels. Symptom: empty `hotels[]` with `meta.total_returned=0` while
  transport search worked.

## Clarifying questions
When a hotel search has many viable options and the user's message does
NOT pin the narrowing preferences (bed setup, breakfast, free
cancellation, view), do NOT call `search_hotels` yet — ask ONE short batch
(2-4 questions) FIRST, then search. This is a pre-call gate, not a
final-answer step: the mistake is starting the search before knowing what
to narrow by.
- Ask once, concise: bed setup (one double vs two singles), breakfast
  included, free cancellation, view / floor / balcony. With children ->
  also extra bed / cot and family-friendly amenities. Don't re-ask things
  already in the message (dates, city, guest count).
- Skip only on explicit minimal-selection signals: "just the cheapest",
  "overnight only", "выбери сам", "лишь бы переночевать". Generic positive
  framing ("хорошее место", "бюджет не критичен") is NOT a preference
  signal — ask anyway.
- Map answers to filters: view/balcony/AC -> `room_amenities`; breakfast
  -> `breakfast_included=true`; free cancel -> `free_cancellation=true`;
  kid-friendly -> `hotel_amenities=['kid_friendly']`; bed preference ->
  annotate from `rooms[].bed_type` in `get_offer_details` (no listing-level
  bed filter today).

## best_offer vs get_offer_details
`best_offer` describes ONLY the cheapest visible rate of one room. For room
categories (standard / comfort / suite), beds, view, size and full
per-rate options, call `get_offer_details`. It defaults to `view='compact'`:
photos are capped, the per-rate `cancellation_policy` ladder text is
omitted (the `free_cancellation` + `free_cancellation_until` flags stay,
so you can still state the policy in one line), room `amenity_groups`
are omitted (the flat `room_amenities` list stays), hotel
`amenity_groups` keep only group + amenity names, and review TEXTS are
omitted — the `review_summary` aggregate (rating, count, aspects) stays.
For the exact cancellation ladder ask `view='rules'`; for guest quotes
(плюсы/минусы from real reviews) ask `view='reviews'` + `review_limit` —
it returns `hotel.reviews[]` with `texts[].sentiment` (pros/cons) and
pagination; `view='full'` returns everything.

## Pricing — whole-stay totals
Every hotel price the tools return is the TOTAL for the requested stay and
guest composition, with the nights already multiplied in: the listing
`best_offer.price`, each `get_offer_details` `rooms[].rates[].price` — both
tagged `price_basis="stay_total"`. Render the number as returned and NEVER
multiply it by the night count; doing so double-counts and overstates the
price. `stay.nights` (top-level in both responses) is only for labelling,
e.g. "42 000 ₽ за 2 ночи". `price_max` is a PER-NIGHT budget — the server
enforces it as `price / stay.nights`, so pass the nightly figure.

## Grounding for asked-for features
Surface the raw field value next to each recommendation and judge
match-vs-mismatch with plain judgment (no decision table).
- View, bed setup -> room-level: `rooms[i].view`, `rooms[i].bed_type`.
- Room area -> in m². The LISTING `best_offer.room_size_sqm` is the more
  reliable source (parsed from the search room_name, e.g. «… от 16 кв.м»);
  `rooms[i].room_size_sqm` in details is usually `null` (Tutu's detail
  upstream rarely carries area). Often a MINIMUM (Tutu's «от N») — label
  «от N м²», don't read it as exact. `null` means Tutu didn't write a size
  (the common case) — say «Tutu не указал площадь», never assume it fails
  or passes a «>35 м²» ask. Do NOT silently drop hotels with unknown size:
  surface the value (or its absence) and let the user decide — a hard size
  cut would empty the list exactly where data is thin (e.g. Сен-Тропе: no
  hotel exposes a size, so a «>35 м²» filter would return zero).
- Breakfast, free cancellation, pay-at-hotel -> RATE-level (rates of one
  room can disagree): `rooms[i].rates[j].*`; in the listing the cheapest
  rate mirrors to `best_offer.breakfast_included` /
  `best_offer.free_cancellation`.
- `view` enum (source `app/repository/hotel_badges.py`): `sea` (explicit
  «на море/океан»), `water` (generic «на воду» — may be pond/canal, NOT
  necessarily sea), `river`, `lake`, `mountain`, `park`, `city`, `yard`,
  `other`, or `None` (Tutu didn't write it). Name the actual enum — don't
  promise «вид на море» when the field says `water`/`river`. When `None`,
  say «Tutu не указал вид». When NO recommended hotel satisfies the ask,
  say so and offer to refine — don't fall back to the cheapest pick as if
  the filter were met.
